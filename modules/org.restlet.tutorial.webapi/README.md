# Restlet Framework Web API Reference Implementation

## Prerequisites

* mySQL installed on your machine : [mySQL installation link](http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/)

> This example uses [Restlet Framework 2.2.1](http://restlet.com/download/current#release=stable&edition=jse&distribution=zip) (Java SE edition).

> Restlet framework user guide is available [here](http://restlet.com/learn/guide/2.3/).

## Installation 

### Create a mySQL database
	
A script was created : ```scripts/mysql.script```. You just have to execute it in your mySQL console.  
If you want to change settings to access you database, you can do it in ```org.restlet.persistence.PersistenceService.java```.

### Run this application
	
The main class is : ```WebApiHost.java```    
By default the application is launched at ```http://localhost:9000```, but you can change it in ```WebApiHost.java```.  
A logger is configured. Its configuration is made in ```logging.properties``` and declared in ```WebApiHost.java```.  
Two files will be created : 
 * ```webapitutorial-app-x-x.log```
 * ```webapitutorial-requests-x-x.log```   

They are both situated in ```tmp``` folder.  
To simplify the launch of the application, authentication and authorization are done in-memory
(You can overwrite that with you own authentication system). Here are the login/password available:

* admin/admin : to get admin role
* owner/owner : to get owner role
* user/user : to get user role

It uses HTTP basic authentication.   

> Learn more about authentication, authorization and security with Restlet Framework [here](http://restlet.com/learn/guide/2.3/core/security/).

> You can try this application easily with a REST client like [POSTMAN](http://www.getpostman.com/).

## Description

This Web API contains 2 main resources : 

* Company : identified by an auto-generated id.
* Contact : identified by its email. A contact can be part of a company and get a reference to it.

This is a diagram of the API : 

![Diagram](/prototypes/RFWebApi/images/RFWebAPIReferenceImplementation.png)

> A Web API definition can be generated with [APISpark extension (RF 2.3)](http://restlet.com/learn/guide/2.3/extensions/apispark). 

## Implementation choices

 * The persistence layer has been done to be as simple as possible. The aim of this example is to show how to build a reference 
 Web API with Restlet Framework.
 * The API was designed to use meaningful URLs. For example, for contacts the email is used as an identifier instead of a technical
 id (which does not mean anything for a user). On the contrary, for companies an autogenerated id has been chosen.
 * There is not POST method for contacts as a contact is defined by his/her email. To add a contact, you must do a PUT on ```/contacts/{email}```

## Next steps

These are some indication to go further in the project

 * Persistence layer 
 	* For each operation a new connection is created.
 	It would be useful to use a connection pool like [DBCP](http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp/).
 	* It is possible to totally dissociate the persistence layer from the Server Resources. 
 	It would allow the use of several persitence layers. It would also be possible to use dependency injection.
 * Authentication/Authorization
 	* It is possible to use an in database users/roles instead of an in-memory one. 
 	You can create a custom [SecretVerifier](http://restlet.org/learn/javadocs/2.2/jse/api/org/restlet/security/SecretVerifier.html)
 	 and [Enroler](http://restlet.org/learn/javadocs/2.2/jse/api/org/restlet/security/Enroler.html).
 	* It is possible to handle autorizations in a filter instead of at the beginning of each class. 
 	In fact, in this example, there is a repeating schema : Role user needed to access to GET methods, 
 	Role owner needed to access the others.

## Utilisation 

> These examples are made using the JSON format but you can use XML or YAML if you want.

### Ping resource

A resource ```/ping``` has been created which does not need authentication.

```GET 		http://localhost:9000/v1/ping```

![Ping Example](/prototypes/RFWebApi/images/ping.png)

> For the following examples, Basic Authentication will be needed

### Create a company
 
 ``` POST	http://localhost:9000/v1/companies/```
 
 ```json
{
  	"name" : "Restlet",
  	"duns" : "123456789",
  	"address" : "2 API road",
  	"zipCode" : "44300",
  	"creationDate" : "2014-01-01",
  	"website" : "http://restlet.com",
  	"city" : "Nantes",
  	"phoneNumber" : "+1 555 555 555"
}
```

![POST Companies](/prototypes/RFWebApi/images/POSTCompanies.png)
 
> The returned status is : ```201 Created```.   

The location of the created company is written is the "location" header.
 
 ![POST Companies headers](/prototypes/RFWebApi/images/POSTCompaniesHeaders.png)
 
### Retrieve all created companies 
 
 ```GET		http://localhost:9000/v1/companies/```

> The trailing slash is optional : both ```http://localhost:9000/v1/companies/``` and ```http://localhost:9000/v1/companies``` will work.
 
 It should retrieve : 
 
 ```json
{
	"list" :
		[
			{
				"duns":"123456789",
				"address":"2 API road",
				"zipCode":"44300",
				"creationDate":"2014-01-01",
				"website":"http://restlet.com",
				"phoneNumber":"+1 555 555 555",
				"city":"Nantes",
				"name":"Restlet",
				"self":"/companies/1"
			}
		]
}
```

![GET Companies](/prototypes/RFWebApi/images/GETCompanies.png)

> ```self``` element refers to the location of the object : ```http://localhost:9000/v1/companies/1```.
> Try ```GET	http://localhost:9000/v1/companies/1``` !

### Create a contact related to the created company 
 
 ```PUT	http://localhost:9000/v1/contacts/{email}```  

  with ```{email}``` representing the email of the contact you want to insert.
 
 For this example, it is : 
 ``` PUT	http://localhost:9000/v1/contacts/gblondeau@restlet.com```  
 
 ```json
 {
 	"name" : "Blondeau", 
 	"firstName" : "Guillaume", 
 	"age" : 22,
 	"company" : "1"
 }
 ```
 
 It should retrieve : 
 
 ```json
 {
	"email":"gblondeau@restlet.com",
	"age":22,
	"name":"Blondeau",
	"firstName":"Guillaume",
	"company":"/companies/1"
}
 ```
 
 ![PUT Contacts](/prototypes/RFWebApi/images/PUTContacts.png)

> The returned status is : ```201 Created```.   
 
> The field company is a reference to the location of the company, with 1 the id of the company. 
 	ie : /companies/1 refers to http://localhost:9000/v1/companies/1
 
### Retrieve the list of created contacts
  
```GET		http://localhost:9000/v1/contacts```

> The trailing slash is optional : both ```http://localhost:9000/v1/contacts/``` and ```http://localhost:9000/v1/contacts``` will work.

It should retrieve : 

```json
{
	"list" :
		[
			{
				"email":"gblondeau@restlet.com",
				"age":22,
				"name":"Blondeau",
				"firstName":"Guillaume",
				"company":"/companies/1",
				"self":"/contacts/gblondeau@restlet.com"
			}
		]
}
```
 
  ![GET Contacts](/prototypes/RFWebApi/images/GETContacts.png)

> The field company is a reference to the location of the company

To display the company information, add the following query parameter : ```?strategy=load```
  
```GET		http://localhost:9000/v1/contacts/?strategy=load```

It should retrieve : 

```json
{
	"list" :
		[
			{
				"email":"gblondeau@restlet.com",
				"age":22,
				"name":"Blondeau",
				"firstName":"Guillaume",
				"company":
					{
						"duns":"123456789",
						"address":"2 API road",
						"zipCode":"44300",
						"creationDate":"2014-01-01",
						"website":"http://restlet.com",
						"phoneNumber":"+1 555 555 555",
						"city":"Nantes",
						"name":"Restlet"
					},
				"self":"/contacts/gblondeau@restlet.com"
			}
		]
}
```

  ![GET Contacts](/prototypes/RFWebApi/images/GETContactsLoad.png)
 
### Modify an existing contact

```PUT		http://localhost:9000/v1/contacts/gblondeau@restlet.com```

```json
{
    "age" : 23,
    "name": "Blondeau",
    "firstName": "Guillaume",
    "company": "1"
}
```

It should retrieve : 

```json
{
    "email": "gblondeau@restlet.com",
    "age": 23,
    "name": "Blondeau",
    "firstName": "Guillaume",
    "company": "/companies/1"
}
```

  ![PUT Contacts](/prototypes/RFWebApi/images/PUTContacts2.png)
  
> This time a ```200 OK ``` is returned because it is not a creation but an update.
